abstract = "We have built a system that would enable the tracking of physical browsing by users in indoor spaces such as retail stores. In a retail store, tracking the physical aspects of a shopper’s behaviour like walking, dwelling, gazing, reaching out, etc. might give us deep insights into the shopper’s interests. Using a combination of a first-person vision enabled by smart glasses, and inertial sensing using both the glasses and a smartphone, we have designed techniques to track each of these physical aspects of the shopper’s behaviour. Apart from retail stores, our system can help track physical browsing in other indoor spaces say during trade shows, conferences etc."
